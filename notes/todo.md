# todo

- [ ] Need to prevent syntax errors in Bread.re from causing build to fail
      and prevent its own regeneration. Can get stuck in a bad state.
- [ ] CamlList -> Caml.List?
      Maybe not. Caml.List can be default functions, CamlList will be nice
      bindings to Caml.List?


I'm here!
- Add module type to modules and use the type information.
- Add <Let> and <TypeDef> modules
- Finish out the core:
  - Option, Result, String, Char, Int, Bool, List, Array, CamlList
- Extras
  - Map, Set
