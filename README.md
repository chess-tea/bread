# Documentation

We don't have docs yet. Hah, take that person exploring this library.

# Development

## Primary commands

- `esy` - Builds and installs
- `esy format` - Runs refmt on all source code
- `esy test` - Runs Rely tests
- `esy gen` - Generates `lib/bread` source code for use

## Directory setup

- `src/bread_config`
  - This is the source code and configuration that will be used to build `lib/bread`. This is a level of indirection that allows outputting more performant, consistent, and better documented code.
- `src/bread_gen`
  - An executable that reads source code and configuration information from `src/bread_config` and creates `lib/bread`.
- `lib/bread`
  - The final output that can be consumed.
  - Everything in here is generated and should not be modified manually.
- `tests/TestExe.re`
  - This is the test executable. Any reason files in `tests` that `open TestFramework` and use `describe` will be registered and run when calling `esy test`.
  - See [reason-native/rely](https://reason-native.com/docs/rely/).
